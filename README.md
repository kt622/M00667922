Software project Python

Written code in python and connected it to a local host to impliment light animations on a simulated 6 LED bar display.
THe interfacing library used is opc.py that allows wireless contact to the LED display.

Designing unique animations to play on the display by clicking buttons created within a window that is also coded from another imported library tkinter.py.

Users open the python file with the "readopcforstrands" document (LED simulator); this document will run the animations as the python is connected to it via the local host.

Buttons will show on Animation window, each button impliments a command that runs an animation.
